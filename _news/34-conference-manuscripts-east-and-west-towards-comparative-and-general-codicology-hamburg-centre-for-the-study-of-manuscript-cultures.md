From 17 to 19 October 2017 the conference "Manuscripts East and West. Towards Comparative and General Codicology" took place in Hamburg University.

The conference, hold by the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures, was dedicated to the well-known codicologist Malachi Beit-Arié, one of the main specialists of Hebrew manuscript culture.
