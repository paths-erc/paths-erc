The conference, entitled “The Virgin Without Borders: The Early Cult of Mary in Byzantium, Egypt, and Syria,” aimed at gathering specialists of different disciplines  for a multi-disciplinary event that made connections across time periods, themes, and fields of inquiry.<br />Paola's paper "Coptic Texts Related to the Virgin Mary: Literary Genres, Milieus of Productions, Place od Circulation" was a direct result of the research work carried out within the "PAThs" project.<br />On this occasion the provisional version of the Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature has been presented.
