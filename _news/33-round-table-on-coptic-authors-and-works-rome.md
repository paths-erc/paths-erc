On 13 October 2017, the PAThs team has organized a new round table in order to discuss the problems related to the identification and classification of Coptic authors and works. I addition to the PAThs members, Tito Orlandi (Professore Emerito della Sapienza), Alberto Camplani and Maryse Robert (Université Laval) were present.

Among the topics which have been dealt with during the round table, there has been the fluidity of Coptic literary tradition – that does not consider authorship as an important element for the authority and authenticity of a work, with the obvious consequence  of the proliferation of a pseudoepigraphical production – and the complex attribution of  a Clavis Coptica to a textual unit, and the even more complicated process of identification of the correspondent Clavis Patrum Graecorum.
