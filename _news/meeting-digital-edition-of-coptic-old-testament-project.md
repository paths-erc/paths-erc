<p>On January 16 and 17, 2017, Paola Buzi has met in  G&ouml;ttingen the members of our project partner "Digital Edition of the Coptic Old Testament" (<a href="http://coptot.manuscriptroom.com" target="_blank">http://coptot.manuscriptroom.com</a>).</p>
<p>During a very intense and fruitful 2-day meeting, it was possible to mutually update about the latest developments of the current research of the two projects and to plan the next steps in our agendas.</p>
<p>It was very stimulating to found out how the our projects are complementary to each other. </p>
<p>The meeting was therefore mainly devoted to explore the best ways to share data e technology.</p>
<p>A new opportunity of discussion will be in June 2107, when some members of "PAThs" will attend a workshop, in G&ouml;ttingen, organized by "Kellia" (Koptische/Coptic Electronic Language and Literature International Alliance), that is a collaboration between "Digital Edition of the Coptic Old Testament", "Coptic SCRIPTORIUM" (<a href="http://copticscriptorium.org" target="_blank">http://copticscriptorium.org</a>), and other partners.</p>
