<hr />
The school was aimed at disseminating the scientific achievements of the PAThs project, training graduate students and junior scholars in methods used in Coptic manuscript studies. Lectures and seminars in topics ranging from Literature to History to Codicology and Cataloguing shall covered the most central aspects of research and help in developing skills necessary for theoretical and practical tasks in the study of manuscripts.

Particular attention was devoted to the develpment of Coptic Literature, to its “literary genres” and to the geography of Coptic manuscript production. Practical exercises included analytical description of Coptic manuscripts.

The school was open to students and scholars of all disciplines, but some degree of knowledge of Christian Orient (not necessarily Coptic) as well as experience of study and/or research dealing with one of the oriental traditions is expected. Basic knowledge of the Coptic language was an appreciated prerequisite.

The class was taught by internationally acknowledged specialists on the topics of Literature, Bible, Manuscript Tradition, Coptic Church etc.

Most of the members of the PAThs project took part in the Summer School as teachers.
