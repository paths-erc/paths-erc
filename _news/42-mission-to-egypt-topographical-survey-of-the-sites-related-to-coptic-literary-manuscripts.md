Paola Buzi, Julian Bogdani, Angelo Colonna and Ilaria Rossetti took part in the first mission to Egypt destined to check and integrate data of archaeological sitesÂ  related to the production, storage and discovery of Coptic literary manuscripts and, more in general, to Christian communities which re-used pharaonic structures.

Old and recent archaeological reports have been used as a guide to verify what of these Christian settlements is still visible.

Specific and not well known structures have been georeferenced, so far unknown inscriptions have been recorded and much attention has been devoted to physical relation among different Christian settlements.

The results of this first mission are extremely valuable for the construction of the Digital Atlas of Coptic Literature, that is the main scientific "product" of PAThs.
