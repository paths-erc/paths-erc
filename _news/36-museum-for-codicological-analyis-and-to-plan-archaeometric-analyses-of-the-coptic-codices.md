Paola Buzi (23-24 October) and Nathan Carlig (23-26 October) have been working in the Egyptian Museum, Turin, to carefully evaluate which fragments and codices should be used for an archaeometric analysis and to continue the codicological study.

Moreover, during the mission much attention has been devoted to several leather bookbindings, that until now had not received any attention, and to a parchment codex, which had been published by Paul de Lagarde (1888) and whose provenance is still to be clarified.Â
