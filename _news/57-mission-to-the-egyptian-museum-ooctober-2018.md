Nathan Carlig (22-26 October) and Francesco Valerio (26 October) have been working in the Egyptian Museum, Turin, to continue the codicological study of the papyrus codices and to reorder the fragments.

Special attention has been devoted by Francesco Valerio to the parchment codex containing the books of Sirach and of the Wisdom of Salamon published by Paul de Lagarde in 1888.
