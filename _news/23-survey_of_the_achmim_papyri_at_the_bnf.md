On the occasion of a private visit to Paris, Nathan Carlig has conducted a survey of the Coptic literary papyri from Achmîm which could be, according to some scholars, the first nucleus of the library of the White Monastery. Particular attention was given to the codicological aspects of these papyri, which will be included in the PAThs database.
