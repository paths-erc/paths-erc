On March 23, 2017, Dr. Pietro Liuzzo (Hamburg University) - specialist of digital humanities and relational databases for the project Beta maṣāḥǝft (Hamburg) has met the PAThs team in order to share reflections concerning technical aspects of the research work, such as the mark-up of texts, the use of identifiers for literary works, the representation of the codicological features of a manuscript, the visual representation of network of scribes.

During the meeting it has been decided that common aspects of the research will be carried out by the two projects - PAThs and  Beta maṣāḥǝft - in strict collaboration and that other round tables will be organised for this purpose.
