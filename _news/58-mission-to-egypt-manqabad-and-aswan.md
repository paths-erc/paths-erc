Paola Buzi and Julian Bogdani  took part in the third mission to Egypt destined to check and integrate data of archaeological sites  related to the Late Antique Period and, more in general, to Christian communities which re-used pharaonic structures or built new settlements.

At first, Paola has worked for a few days at the Monastery of Abba Nefer (Manqabad, Asyut) within the mission directed by Rosanna Pirelli, then Paola and Julian explored the area between Kom Ombo and Aswan.

Old and recent archaeological reports have been used as a guide to verify what of these Christian settlements is still visible.

The results of third mission are, as usual, extremely valuable for the construction of the Digital Atlas of Coptic Literature, that is the main scientific “product” of PAThs.
